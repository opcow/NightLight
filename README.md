# NightLight
A data field for the Garmin Edge series that will turn the backlight on at sunset and off at sunrise.

## Settings
* Offsets in minutes from sunset/sunrise
* Data field can be set to display one of time, speed cadence, distance, heart rate, ascent, descent, or altitude.

## Note:
You will need to use the settings dialog to enter your longitude and lattitude before using this data field, as data fields can't access postition data. =(
